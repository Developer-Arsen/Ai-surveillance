Task 4. Functions
Write a program that contains functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Each function should accept two parameters and return the result of the operation. Test these functions by invoking them from the main function. This task introduces the concept of functions, parameter passing, and return types.


Task 5. Arrays and Strings
Implement a program where you define an array of integers and populate it with some values. Write functions to find the maximum, minimum, and average values in the array. Additionally, create a string variable and demonstrate basic string operations like concatenation and length calculation. This task focuses on data collection management using arrays and strings.


Task 6. Pointers and References
Create a program that declares an integer variable, a pointer variable, and a reference variable. Assign the address of the integer to the pointer and manipulate the data using both the pointer and the reference. Output the results to ensure an understanding of how pointers and references are used to access and modify data.
