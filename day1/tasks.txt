Task 1. Hello World Program
Write a C++ program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. This task will introduce you to the basic structure of a C++ program, including the main function and console output using std::cout.


Task 2. Data Types and Variables
Create a C++ program that demonstrates the use of different C++ data types (int, float, double, char, bool). Declare variables for each type, assign them values, and output their values to the console. This task helps understand the basic data types and variable declaration in C++.


Task 3. Control Structures
Develop a program that asks the user for a number and then, using if-else statements, checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. Extend the program with a switch-case to assign a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on a number range (e.g., 90-100 for A). Lastly, implement a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10. This task teaches the fundamental control structures for program flow.
