Task 3. Control Structures
Develop a program that asks the user for a number and then, using if-else statements, checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. 
Extend the program with a switch-case to assign a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on a number range (e.g., 90-100 for A). 
Lastly, implement a loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10. This task teaches the fundamental control structures for program flow.
