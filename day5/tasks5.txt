Task 12. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Design a Book class with attributes such as title, author, and ISBN. Include methods that
allow setting and getting these attributes. In the main function, create an instance of the Book
class and demonstrate setting and retrieving its attributes. This task is designed to introduce
the principles of OOP, encapsulation, and the use of classes and objects.


Task 13. Inheritance
Create a base class Shape with a method to calculate the area and derive
two classes from it: Circle and Rectangle. Implement the area calculation method for
each derived class. This task introduces the concept of inheritance and polymorphism.


Task 14. Virtual Functions and Polymorphism
Modify the Shape class to make the area calculation method virtual. 
Create a function that takes a pointer to a Shape and prints its area, 
demonstrating polymorphic behavior. This task explores dynamic polymorphism and the use of virtual functions.
